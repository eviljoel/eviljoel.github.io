        <h2>Running a Truly Open Source Android Stack</h2>
        <p>I gave this talk at the Chicago Linux Users Group on Saturday, June 16th, 2018.

        <h3>Original Summary</h3>
        <p>In 2008, open source enthusiasts rejoiced as Google released Android as an open source mobile operating system. However, ten years later, Google has been able to maintain control over Android by gradually releasing application updates and API extensions under proprietary licenses. Google Play Services is of particular concern, with many, if not most Android applications requiring this proprietary API. This talk will show you how you can run a very functional Android environment with almost no proprietary code, giving you more control over your private information and other data.</p>
        <p>Specifically, this talk will go over general Android architecture, LineageOS, a feature called Signature Spoofing, and MicroG. It will cover why you should use these tools and projects and how to install them. Finally, if time permits, I'll cover open source replacements for your favorite Android applications, how to transfer Signal data between phones, and how to make bit for bit backups of your Android operating system and data.</p>
